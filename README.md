This is my version of website, that was orginally made by [JS Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls).


Here, I've created a full COVID-19 Tracker. I've used React, Charts.JS and Material UI.

I got a strong understanding of React's workflow and the use of hooks, while making this project.

API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
